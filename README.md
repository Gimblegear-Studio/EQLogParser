# EQLogParser
Everquest Log Parser for Live? servers. 

The software depends on a Docking UI control from Actipro so needs a license to build
and run without having an Actipro splash screen. One day I may find a good replacement
so that it's all open source. I've only tested on Live but it may work fine on TLP.
I imagine it won't work at all for P99.

The Releases folder has recent builds as well as asc files to verify signatures. I've
uploaded a public GPG key to https://eq.kizant.net/Kauffman12.asc and to
http://keys.gnupg.net/ under kauffman12@gmail.com if you want to download from there
and compare to what I've uploaded here.
